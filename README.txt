Magically add an extra space between Chinese / Japanese characters and English letters / numbers / common punctuation marks

== Description ==

This plugin uses [vinta/paranoid-auto-spacing](https://github.com/vinta/paranoid-auto-spacing) to magically add an extra space between Chinese / Japanese characters and English letters / numbers / common punctuation marks.

A must-have plugin if you're running a Chinese / Japanese blog. This plugin also works fine with multisite enabled WordPress (aka. WordPress Mu).

No options, no additional database inserts, no stupid banners and shitty ads, install and go.

你客戶／合作夥伴不光文案寫的爛，而且還不會排版？Space Lover 可以幫到你。它會神奇的在中文、日文和英文、數字、符號之間自動加入空白，讓客戶網站的文案、文章看上去規範整潔。

覺得這招治標不治本？也可以試試 [sparanoid/chinese-copywriting-guidelines](https://github.com/sparanoid/chinese-copywriting-guidelines)，讓你的客戶／合作夥伴學會如何正確的排版。
